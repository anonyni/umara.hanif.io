This is a snapshot of what my life looks like right now as a final-year PhD student at NUS: a lot of thesis-writing, a lot of LaTeX, and a lot of thoughts about the future.

{{< toc mobile_only=true is_open=true >}}

## 1. Writing and Finishing My PhD Thesis

Most of my energy is going into **turning several years of work into a coherent story**:

- bringing together my work on **FPGA security**, **hardware fuzzing**, and **IoT swarm attestation**
- deciding what belongs in the “core” chapters vs. appendices
- polishing figures, experiments, and explanations so that the thesis is readable not only for security experts, but also for a broader systems audience

It’s a strange mix of deep technical details and big-picture reflection: _What did I actually learn from all these experiments? What would I do differently if I started again?_

## 2. Paper Revisions & Submissions

Alongside the thesis, I’m actively working on revising and submitting papers based on my PhD work.

### ENVOT

**ENVOT** is my framework for **secure attestation of IoT swarms using ensemble learning**.  

Right now I am:

- polishing the experimental section,
- tightening the threat model and assumptions,
- and clarifying how ENVOT compares to prior work in terms of **latency, energy, and robustness**.

I’m waiting to see how it will go after major revisoon submission.

### Crashing Smarter and Catching in IoT-Class FPGAs

I’m also revising a paper on **“crashing smarter and catching faster in IoT-class FPGAs”**, which currently also has a **major revision** decision.

My focus here is to:

- strengthen the evaluation (more datasets / boards where possible),
- make the attack and defense models clearer,
- and better explain the practical implications for real IoT-class FPGA deployments.

It’s a lot of back-and-forth between code, experiments, and reviewer comments—but it’s also where the work really sharpens.

## 3. Searching for My First Full-Time Role

In parallel, I’m **actively looking for full-time positions**, especially roles that sit at the intersection of:

- **hardware / FPGA / IoT security**
- **systems and platform security**
- **applied research or research-engineer positions** in industry or research labs

Right now that means:

- updating and tailoring my **CV, website, and cover letters**
- reaching out to people whose work I admire
- trying to keep a healthy balance between **job applications** and **actually finishing the thesis and papers**

If you’re working on related problems or know opportunities in these areas, I’m always happy to connect.

## 4. Outside the Thesis: Reading & Thinking

When I’m not buried in experiments or revisions, I’m usually reading about:

- the **neuroscience of decision-making and communication**
- how humans coordinate, argue, and build shared understanding
- how these ideas might transfer to how we design secure systems and communicate risks

It’s slow progress, but it keeps me curious and reminds me why I like research in the first place.
