abstract: 
 Ensuring the security of FPGA-enabled cyber-physical systems is critical in safety-sensitive and mission-critical environments. This paper presents **Alexis**, a novel anomaly-based intrusion detection framework for FPGA bitstreams using an autoencoder-driven approach. Alexis leverages entropy-ranked feature selection and checksum-based integrity validation combined with reconstruction-error analysis to detect hardware Trojans and configuration-time tampering. Experimental evaluation on real FPGA platforms demonstrates detection accuracy of up to 91%, high AUC values reaching 0.96, and minimal computational overhead. The results validate Alexis as a scalable and efficient attestation mechanism for enhancing FPGA security in resource-constrained cyber-physical systems.

summary: 
 We propose **Alexis**, an autoencoder-based anomaly detection framework for FPGA bitstream attestation, achieving high detection accuracy and low computational overhead for cyber-physical systems security.
